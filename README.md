# Multi environment DEVOps pipeline for Flask App with SQL Database

CoPilot thread:  GitHub actions deploy lookout app

## New notes with the databases running, connected and populated with Flask-Migrate

ps aux | grep flask

so my workflow every time I update any models is to makes changes to def create_app():
- from .models import [every table] 
run flask db migrate -m "[comment]" 
make adjustments to the python file created in versions (like comment out system tables that should not be dropped) 
finally run flask db upgrade


I stopped and rebuilt the containers  
docker compose down 
then docker compose up --build 
connect to sql now, there is no lookout table
python app.py
the database exists
flask db migrate -m "Initial table creation"
	there are versions already there (sometimes they should be deleted?)
flask db upgrade
The table exists
http://localhost:5000/, http://localhost:5000/env, http://localhost:5000/db-check, 


it runs without error in codespaces, but brings up the wrong/old website and I cannot connect to the database
ps aux | grep flask, kill the top one
python app.py (or change the environment variable)





## Dev environment - Local
- Two Linux containers
  - Custom Flask app container with code and connection to ...
  - A pre-built SQL server container
- From VSCode on laptop
  - ctrl + Shft + P
  - dev containers: attach to running container
  - Select the dev container
- Dev process using two contaners
  - Docker-Desktop must be running!
  - Open the lookout-app Workspace. (CL\dev\lookout app)
  - Run docker compose up --build
  - dev containers: attach to running container
  - http://localhost:5000/[route]
- Shutting down:
  - Option 1 > docker compose down
  - Option 2 > in the terminal where docker compose up --build was run, press ctrl + c and then enter to see the containers shutting down.
- Use docker ps -a to see the containers that are running (or exited):
  - if the containers show as exited and they need to be rebuilt, use docker compose down first.

## Dev Environment - codespaces
export FLASK_APP=app/main.py
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=5000

This should produce an output in the terminal indicating that Flask is running

go to the ports tab of the codespaces terminal pane
for a link to the Flask app in a browser

## GitHub Secrets

ðŸ§­ Environment Overview
| Environment    | Secrets Source | Notes                            | Secret Type
| Dev Local      | .env file      | Local-only, not synced to GitHub | .env
| Dev Codespaces | GitHub Secrets | Injected via devcontainer.json   | GH repository secret
| Staging        | GitHub Secrets | Used in GitHub Actions workflows | GH environment secret (stg)
| Production     | GitHub Secrets | Used in GitHub Actions workflows | GH environment secret (prod)


## Debugging in the codespaces environment
It is possible to simply write code in the codespaces VSCode like normal. To Rerun the Flask application:
- export FLASK_APP=app.main:app
- Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000



## tagged a "good" build
- git add .
- git commit -m "Stable local dev setup: Dockerfile, .env handling, requirements.txt"
- git tag -a local-dev-stable-v1 -m "Stable local dev environment with working Docker build"
- git push origin master
- git push origin local-dev-stable-v1

- To checkout this exact state later: git checkout local-dev-v1
